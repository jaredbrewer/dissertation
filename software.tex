High-resolution, high-throughput microscopy has opened possibilities for biological analysis that were inconceivable only a few short years ago, but the methods by which to analyze these data remain largely lacking. While heroic efforts have been made to use both standard thresholding methods as well as newer machine learning-powered methods to simplify and automate image processing, these approaches are often somewhat limited the range of purposes for which they were designed. Additionally, many of the tasks that experimenters seek to do are both relatively simple and highly repetitive but they are often unaware of the means by which to cut down on manual processing time in order to economize their time and energies. These scripts are a combination of automation scripts that will process particular image types into smaller and more informative images (compression of Z-stacks, time-series, etc.) and those meant for analysis of image data (pixel intensity distribution across an image, bacterial burden within larval zebrafish). While none of these are of the caliber to open entirely new methods of analysis, I hope they are a catalyst for others in the zebrafish community at large to explore the potential for computational automation to save time and frustration in the process of analyzing often thousands of very large, data-rich images.

All of the scripts, in their latest versions will be able to be found at http://github.com/jaredbrewer/image-analysis for the conceivable future. A static version of these has been created at Zenodo (). Scripts at the end for RNA sequencing analysis are available at Zenodo ().
