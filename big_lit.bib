@article{Drobniewski1995,
	abstract = {Since the mid-1980s, the rate of decline in reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) has reached a plateau or reversed because of a combination of poverty and increased homelessness, immigration and displacement, poorly managed and supplied TB control programmes and, particularly in the developing world, the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TB in HIV-positive patients may present atypically, both clinically and radiologically, with a lower probability of sputum positivity, greater difficulty in diagnosis, and a more rapid clinical deterioration than TB in HIV-seronegative patients. The emergence of multiple-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, particularly in patients infected by HIV, carries a high mortality and has been associated with outbreaks in Europe and the USA. Microscopy and culture form the basis of diagnosis, but there is a need for more rapid diagnostic techniques and novel methods of drug susceptibility testing. Prolonged supervised treatment programmes and the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and regimens are essential prerequisites for successful TB therapy in AIDS patients. This review examines the clinical, microbiological and epidemiological issues associated with TB in HIV-infected individuals.},

@article{Hawgood2007,
	abstract = {Early in his medical career, Albert Calmette showed a remarkable aptitude for bacteriology and, in 1891, he opened the first daughter Pasteur Institute in Saigon, French Indochina at the request of Louis Pasteur. In 1894, at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Calmette succeeded in developing an antiserum to cobra venom and so initiated antivenomous serotherapy. In 1895 Calmette was asked to found a second daughter, Pasteur Institute in Lille. Soon he was joined by the young veterinarian, Camille Guerin, and so began a unique partnership, the two men striving to free people from the dreadful scourge of tuberculosis. Investigating the intestinal route of tuberculous infection, Calmette and Guerin began to grow Mycobacterium tuberculosis bovis in a beef bile-glycerine medium. With continuous replanting of the culture in this medium (from 70 to 235 times), an attenuated bacillus of fixed properties was discovered; this Calmette called Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Exhaustive testing of BCG showed its safety and effectiveness in protecting young animals against tuberculosis. In 1924 vaccination of newborn infants with BCG began in France and spread worldwide.},

@article{Silva1988,
	abstract = {The mechanism by which cord factor (CF), a toxic glycolipid from mycobacteria, induces cachexia was studied in BALB/c mice. Body weight was markedly reduced 48 h after CF administration; the animals became severely wasted and exhibited hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in plasma. After CF administration, a transferable factor which caused cachexia and hypertriglyceridemia in recipient mice was detected in the blood. Dexamethasone partially inhibited the cachexia-inducing action of CF. Conditioned medium from adherent peritoneal cell cultures incubated with CF produced the same wasting symptoms when inoculated intravenously into mice. These studies also demonstrated that adherent peritoneal cells produced a humoral factor in response to CF which was related to CF-induced cachexia. Antiserum to recombinant TNF-alpha prevented the cachectin action in passive-transfer experiments. Our findings indicate that cachectin (TNF) plays a role as a central mediator of the wasting induced by CF.},

@article{Chang2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis and is associated with poor prognosis. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind such weight loss could reveal targets for therapeutic intervention. The role of appetite-regulatory hormones in tuberculosis is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 41 subjects with newly-diagnosed pulmonary TB (cases) were compared to 82 healthy controls. We measured appetite, body mass index (BMI), % body fat (BF), plasma peptide YY (PYY), leptin, ghrelin, and resistin for all subjects. Measurements were taken at baseline for controls and at treatment days 0, 30, and 60 for cases. Baseline appetite, BMI, and BF were lower in cases than in controls and improved during treatment. PYY, ghrelin, and resistin were significantly elevated in cases and fell during treatment. Leptin was lower in cases and rose with treatment. Appetite was inversely related to PYY in cases. High pre-treatment PYY predicted reduced gains in appetite and BF. PYY was the strongest independent predictor of appetite in cases across all time points. CONCLUSIONS: Appetite-regulatory hormones are altered in TB patients. As hormones normalize during treatment, appetite is restored and nutritional status improves. High baseline PYY is an indicator of poor prognosis for improvement in appetite and nutrition during treatment. Wasting in TB patients may partly be mediated by upregulation of PYY with resulting appetite suppression.},

@article{Loddenkember2015,
	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) in adults can present in a large number of ways. The lung is the predominant site of TB. Primary pulmonary TB should be distinguished from postprimary pulmonary TB, which is the most frequent TB manifestation in adults (70%-80% cases). Cough is common, although the chest radiograph often raises suspicion of disease. Sputum sampling is a key step in the diagnosis of TB, and invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy may be necessary to achieve adequate samples for diagnosis. Extrapulmonary involvement, which may present many years after exposure, occurs in a variable proportion of cases (20%-45%). This reflects the country of origin of patients and also the frequency of associated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. In the latter case, the presentation of TB is often nonspecific, and care needs to be taken to not miss the diagnosis. Anti-TB therapy should be given in line with proven (or assumed) drug resistance. In extrapulmonary TB, adjunctive therapeutic measures may be indicated; although in all cases, support is often required to ensure that people are able to complete treatment with minimal adverse events and maximal adherence to the prescribed regimen, and so reduce risk of future disease for themselves and others.},

Major roadblocks limiting the development and effectiveness of new drugs to combat tuberculosis are the profound innate resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to host defense mechanisms as well as its intrinsic tolerance to chemotherapeutic reagents. The triangle of interactions among the pathogen, the host responses, and the drugs used to cure the disease are critical for the outcome of tuberculosis. We must better understand this three-way interaction in order to develop drugs that are able to kill the bacillus in the most effective way and minimize the emergence of drug resistance. Here we review our recent understanding of the molecular basis underlying intrinsic antibiotic resistance and survival tactics of M. tuberculosis. This knowledge may help to reveal current targets for the development of novel antituberculosis drugs.},

@article{Stanley2003,
	abstract = {Although many bacterial pathogens use specialized secretion systems for virulence, no such systems have been described for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major pathogen of humans that proliferates in host macrophages. In a screen to identify genes required for virulence of M. tuberculosis, we have discovered three components and two substrates of the first Sec-independent secretion pathway described in M. tuberculosis, which we designate the Snm pathway. Here we demonstrate that the proteins Snm1, -2, and -4 are required for the secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, small proteins previously identified as major T cell antigens. Snm2, a member of the AAA ATPase family, interacts with substrates and with Snm1, another AAA ATPase. We show that M. tuberculosis mutants lacking either the Snm system or these substrates exhibit defects in bacterial growth during the acute phase of a mouse infection and are attenuated for virulence. Strikingly, snm mutants fail to replicate in cultured macrophages and to inhibit macrophage inflammatory responses, two well established activities of wild-type M. tuberculosis bacilli. Thus, the Snm secretion pathway works to subvert normal macrophage responses and is a major determinant of M. tuberculosis virulence.},

	abstract = {By virtue of their position at the crossroads between the innate and adaptive immune response, macrophages play an essential role in the control of bacterial infections. Paradoxically, macrophages serve as the natural habitat to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb subverts the macrophage's mechanisms of intracellular killing and antigen presentation, leading ultimately to the development of tuberculosis (TB) disease. Here, we describe mechanisms of Mtb uptake by the macrophage and address key macrophage functions that are targeted by Mtb-specific effector molecules enabling this pathogen to circumvent host immune response. The macrophage functions described in this review include fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes, production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, antigen presentation and major histocompatibility complex class II expression and trafficking, as well as autophagy and apoptosis. All these are Mtb-targeted key cellular pathways, normally working in concert in the macrophage to recognize, respond, and activate 'proper' immune responses. We further analyze and discuss major molecular interactions between Mtb virulence factors and key macrophage proteins and provide implications for vaccine and drug development.},

These evolutionarily ancient structures form in response to persistent particulate stimuli-infectious or noninfectious-that individual macrophages cannot eradicate. Granulomas evolved as protective responses to destroy or sequester particles but are frequently pathological in the context of foreign bodies, infections, and inflammatory diseases. We summarize recent findings that suggest that the granulomatous response unfolds in a stepwise program characterized by a series of macrophage activations and transformations that in turn recruit additional cells and produce structural changes. We explore why different granulomas vary and the reasons that granulomas are protective and pathogenic. Understanding the mechanisms and role of granuloma formation may uncover new therapies for the multitude of granulomatous diseases that constitute serious medical problems while enhancing the protective function of granulomas in infections.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized to play a crucial role in human health. Using cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE)-deficient mice, we demonstrate an unexpected role of H2S in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis. We showed that Mtb-infected CSE(-/-) mice survive longer than WT mice, and support reduced pathology and lower bacterial burdens in the lung, spleen, and liver. Similarly, in vitro Mtb infection of macrophages resulted in reduced colony forming units in CSE(-/-) cells. Chemical complementation of infected WT and CSE(-/-) macrophages using the slow H2S releaser GYY3147 and the CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine demonstrated that H2S is the effector molecule regulating Mtb survival in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CSE promotes an excessive innate immune response, suppresses the adaptive immune response, and reduces circulating IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma levels in response to Mtb infection. Notably, Mtb infected CSE(-/-) macrophages show increased flux through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby establishing a critical link between H2S and central metabolism. Our data suggest that excessive H2S produced by the infected WT mice reduce HIF-1alpha levels, thereby suppressing glycolysis and production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12, and increasing bacterial burden. Clinical relevance was demonstrated by the spatial distribution of H2S-producing enzymes in human necrotic, nonnecrotic, and cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) lesions. In summary, CSE exacerbates TB pathogenesis by altering immunometabolism in mice and inhibiting CSE or modulating glycolysis are potential targets for host-directed TB control.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has infected humans for millennia. M. tuberculosis is well adapted to establish infection, persist in the face of the host immune response and be transmitted to uninfected individuals. Its ability to complete this infection cycle depends on it both evading and taking advantage of host immune responses. The outcome of M. tuberculosis infection is often a state of equilibrium characterized by immunological control and bacterial persistence. Recent data have highlighted the diverse cell populations that respond to M. tuberculosis infection and the dynamic changes in the cellular and intracellular niches of M. tuberculosis during the course of infection. M. tuberculosis possesses an arsenal of protein and lipid effectors that influence macrophage functions and inflammatory responses; however, our understanding of the role that specific bacterial virulence factors play in the context of diverse cellular reservoirs and distinct infection stages is limited. In this Review, we discuss immune evasion and provocation by M. tuberculosis during its infection cycle and describe how a more detailed molecular understanding is crucial to enable the development of novel host-directed therapies, disease biomarkers and effective vaccines.},
