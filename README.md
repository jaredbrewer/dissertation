Compiled using XeLaTeX using --shell-escape and Bibtex bibliography compilation. Compiles without errors using Texifier 1.9.18.

I had some issues with it finding my installation of Pygments, so I provided a precise directory, but this may change over time and is only relevant to an Apple Silicon macOS installation from Homebrew. Any future user may need to adjust these settings to get proper source code formatting throughout the document.

Parts of the code to format different aspects are taken from StackExchange and are easily findable using basic searching. All credit goes to the original authors for sharing these approaches.

The basic template for this document is taken from the one provided by Duke University, although the original provides numerous errors upon compilation due to an erroneous missing measurement. The .cls file provided here should be broadly reusable by others at Duke for future theses.
