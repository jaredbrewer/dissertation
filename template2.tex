\abstract

Pathological angiogenesis is a widespread phenomenon that influences the progression of a variety of diseases, including autoimmune conditions, cancers, and microbial infections. One infection in particular, tuberculosis, induces a potent pro-angiogenic signaling cascade that increases bacterial burden and disease progression, but many of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, I have delineated a discrete host signaling pathway within responding macrophages that first detects a particular glycolipid on the surface of the bacteria, transduces an intracellular signaling cascade, and drives production of the master regulatory angiogenic chemokine, VEGFA. This signaling pathway is driven by activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 2 (NFATC2) downstream of trehalose 6-6Õ-dimycolate (TDM) detection. Characterization of this pathway resolves a major unknown factor in the signaling mechanisms underlying this maladaptive host response and may offer opportunities for host-directed therapeutic intervention in mycobacterial infections as well as being potentially generalizable to other disease contexts.

\dedication

For my daily motivation and inspiration; for the person who taught me to read and write, who always believed I could do anything I set my mind to, and who dreamt of this day - my Mamaw Barb.

\acknowledgements

The number of people who warrant thanks exceeds my capacity to thank them and the space allotted. Suffice it to say that this entire journey would not have been possible without the multifold support systems that got me to where I am today.

First and foremost, my advisor, David Tobin, who was a constant and unconditional source of support and encouragement through the long experimentation that was required for much of the work presented in these coming pages. He provided me the academic and scientific freedom to find my path in science and to fail (repeatedly) with the unwavering faith that I would succeed.

In my darkest days of graduate school, Andy Alspaugh was the shining presence I needed to realize that I could go on and succeed and he has been there every step of the way, encouraging me to pursue my dreams and giving me support in the way that only he is capable. His kindness is an inspiration to all.

Lastly, I want to thank my loving partner, Kristen, who has believed in me and supported me throughout the past 4 years. As is often said of the long-suffering partner, she has tolerated the days, nights, and weeks that I was completely absent and, when I finally had a break, welcomed me home with no (visible) resentment and for that I will be forever thankful.

%A large document requires a lot of input. Rather than putting the whole input in a single large file, it's more efficient to split it into several smaller ones. Regardless of how many separate files you use, there is one that is the root file; it is the one whose name you type when you run LaTeX. In this template, the introduction chapter is an external file (intro.tex) and the second chapter is contained internally in the root file (in this file you are reading)

Jared was born in the mountains of Appalachia in Barbourville, KY in 1994. After graduating valedictorian from Barbourville High School, he enrolled at Transylvania University in Lexington, KY where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and Political Science, \textit{summa cum laude}. In the fall of 2016, he began his Ph.D. at Duke University in the Molecular Genetics and Microbiology department, having been awarded a James B. Duke Fellowship. He then joined the lab of David Tobin in the summer of 2017. In his time at Duke, he was awarded a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award F31 fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
