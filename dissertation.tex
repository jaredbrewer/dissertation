\abstract

Pathological angiogenesis is a widespread biological phenomenon that influences the progression of various diseases, including autoimmune conditions, cancers, and microbial infections. One infection in particular, tuberculosis, is associated with the induction of a potent pro-angiogenic signaling cascade that facilitates bacterial growth and accelerates disease progression. A synthesis of early studies on bacterial factors that drive host angiogenesis with modern genetic findings identified the mycobacterial glycolipid trehalose 6-6'-dimycolate (TDM) as a critical factor driving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) production and angiogenesis during mycobacterial infection. Despite these recent findings, many of the underlying host response mechanisms remain unknown. 

The introductory chapter will serve to introduce the reader to the major concepts addressed in this work: \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis} and the disease it causes, the role of macrophages in health and disease, the function of pattern recognition receptors in detecting microbial ligands, the specific downstream intracellular signaling pathway of interest for this work (mediated by the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT), the contributions of angiogenesis to diverse contexts and pathologies, and the promise of host-directed therapies to overcome challenges associated with traditional treatment approaches in infectious disease. 

Chapter 2 describes the new and existing methodological approaches that were required to complete this work. This work utilizes the zebrafish-\textit{Mycobacterium marinum} model of tuberculosis infection to facilitate in depth \textit{in vivo} observation and quantitation of these phenomena. Using this model in tandem with human macrophage cell culture, I was able to model major aspects of the host-pathogen interface, enabling me to identify a critical role for a macrophage-C-type lectin receptor-NFATC2-VEGFA signaling axis required for the angiogenic response to mycobacterial infection and TDM, findings that comprise the core of this work and are detailed at length in Chapter 3. 

The analysis of the large amounts of data generated in this work required creative approaches to data processing and analysis. To this end, I have developed a set of novel processing modalities in Python and R that are capable of the rapid and reproducible processing of images as well as certain aspects of automated data collection therefrom. These macros, many written for the FIJI/ImageJ programming environment, serve as the infrastructure on which the rest of this work has been built. These will be detailed in Chapter 4.

Finally, this body of work leaves many questions as yet unanswered. While it is clear that NFAT signaling is required for VEGFA production, the precise mechanism by which this may work is unclear and could be mediated by either direct DNA binding or indirect activation or cooperative binding with some other transcriptional activator. There also exist a variety of other potential NFAT- and angiogenesis-related phenotypes worthy of exploring using the tools and approaches  I have developed. It is my hope that the findings herein stimulate further study on the contributions of NFAT signaling to the host immune response to mycobacterial infection and evaluation of the potential of NFAT inhibition as host-directed therapy to tuberculosis.

This document is the culmination of my entire twenty-five-year-long academic career to date and would have been impossible without all of the people along the way who have supported, inspired, and taught me all I needed to get here. The number of people who warrant thanks exceeds my capacity to thank them and the space allotted. 

From the time of my birth, I had one member of my family who always knew I could be something amazing and labored to ensure I became all that and more -- my Mamaw Barb. While she was lost to us far too soon, her contributions to my life echo into the present and, were her life's circumstances different, she could have been the one to become the first Brewer with a Ph.D. with her brilliant mind, dedication, and love of knowledge.

My journey into the world of learning would not have been possible without the manifold contributions of those primary and secondary school teachers who saw my potential and worked to help me achieve it. From kindergarten all the way to my senior year of high school I had beacons who guided me to overcome the difficult cultural and familial conditions into which I was born and raised. These contributions are what set me on the path to where I am today and I will forever appreciate those who strove to uplift students from the difficult educational environment of Barbourville.

The inflection point of my life was the four years I spent at Transylvania University. It was truly the place where everything changed. This was where I really found myself and was pushed to my intellectual limits and beyond and I  discovered a true passion for teaching. Paul Duffin introduced me to the wonders of bench science and gave me a platform to learn, discover, and fail that provided me the precise mentality I needed to succeed in graduate school. Scott Whiddon has always been my \#1 cheerleader and has been an invaluable source of support both throughout my time at Transylvania and into the present day. Michael Cairo sparked in me a love for political science and gave me the support, affirmation, and down-to-earth advising I needed to find my own academic identity. Lastly, Jeff Freyman gave me the most rigorous and exhilarating set of academic experiences of my life to date -- the courses I took with him showed me the power to change someone's life in the classroom because his courses, approach to teaching, and pursuit of the Truth changed my entire worldview. More than perhaps anybody else, Jeff showed me how academia can be a path to the \textit{bonum vitae} and set me on this path I am now at yet another crossroads along.

Of course, college is not merely the classes you take and I had the privilege of meeting countless friends who taught me who I was and who I wanted to become, many of whom have been with me continuously for the past decade. Bobby Puckett is the first of my peers I had ever met who filled me with intellectual awe and his mentorship, especially in my first-year of college, set me on a path to further success. He believed in me, encouraged me, humbled me, and supported me all along this path I have taken and fostered my emotional and mental development in untold ways through my entire first-year and continuously into the present. I also had the privilege to surround myself with an amazing set of immediate peers -- Chanslor Gallenstein, Drew Cunningham, Ryan Hanson, Susan Northcutt, and Quentin Becker -- who have been there from the day we moved into Clay Hall until today. And Rachel Johnson kept my ego in check as she outperformed and outclassed me at every turn and taught me so much about humility and grace (and what tuberculosis was). As my college career advanced, I had the opportunity to meet incredible people at every stage who made a difference. Jared Auton is an impeccable soul with a fervor for art who taught me about the beauty of the world around us. Daniel Martell and John Mays gave me invaluable opportunities in mentorship and taught me how \textit{I} could make a real difference in the lives of others. And Daniel Cooper is shining light of positivity and joy who keeps me thinking with an optimistic mindset and with nothing but hope for the future. There are undoubtedly others I have missed, but the sum of those four years and the people who touched my life throughout them have been essential to my personal growth and success.

Graduate school itself, of course, has been a wonderful experience in growth and challenge. From the first days of this experience, there has been one person who I have been able to rely on for support -- Andy Alspaugh. He has always believed in me and my ability to go on and has always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. His kindness is an immeasurable inspiration I can only vainly attempt to replicate for others. Graduate school has given me a body of peers who I have had the joy to meet and learn from at various stages, including Joe Saelens, Eric Walton, Ryan Finethy, Jessie Finethy, Molly Matty, Allison Roder, Shannon Esher, Hannah Brown, Al Harding, Matt Sacco, Stephen Walsh, Dulcemaria Hernandez, and Mollie Sweeney. These people have all impacted my life in critical ways and have helped me grow into the scientist (and adult) I am today. Lastly, I would like to thank Mark Cronan, the devil always on my shoulder encouraging me to try the risky experiment and who kept me in the lab way too late with riveting scientific, political, and personal conversation. He is my model of how to be a great scientist and I am fortunate to have had the pleasure to know him. My time in Durham has also brought a lost connection back -- Austin Farmer -- one of the very few who also left our hometown to experience something different and pursue his dreams and we have picked right back up where we left off ten years ago. 

Of course, my advisor, David Tobin, has been a constant and unconditional source of support and encouragement through the long experimentation that was required for much of the work presented in these coming pages. He provided me the academic and scientific freedom to find my path in science and to fail (repeatedly) with the unwavering faith that I would succeed. His personal kindness has also made the tribulations of these six years possible and he is truly a selfless soul with the unfettered desire to help others succeed. The trials of graduate school would have been impossible to overcome without his constant support. The rest of my thesis committee also warrants acknowledgement for being there for me since the very beginning and supporting, encouraging, and constructively criticizing me along the way -- John Rawls, Chris Kontos, Dennis Ko, and Andy Alspaugh.

Lastly, I want to thank my loving partner in this life, Kristen Stockdale, who has believed in me and supported me throughout the past 4 years. As is often said of the long-suffering partner, she has tolerated the days, nights, and weeks that I was completely absent and, when I finally had a break, welcomed me home with no (visible) resentment and for that I will be forever thankful. She brings balance to my life and reminds me of all the other things that there are to do in the world beyond the lab and her presence reminds me I should probably just go home instead of running that 6 PM gel.

Jared was born in the mountains of Appalachia in Barbourville, KY in 1994. After graduating valedictorian (in a class of 57) from Barbourville High School, he enrolled at Transylvania University in Lexington, KY where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and Political Science, \textit{summa cum laude} in May 2016. In the fall of 2016, he began his Ph.D. at Duke University in the Molecular Genetics and Microbiology department, having been awarded a James B. Duke Fellowship. He then joined the lab of David Tobin in the summer of 2017. He attended the Cold Spring Harbor course ``Programming for Biologists'' in the fall of 2017, where he learned Python. In his time at Duke, he has contributed to a number of publications, including ``Cyclopropane Modification of Trehalose Dimycolate Drives Granuloma Angiogenesis and Mycobacterial Growth through Vegf Signaling'' by Walton et al. (2018), ``A Non-Canonical Type 2 Immune Response Coordinates Tuberculous Granuloma Formation and Epithelialization'' by Cronan and Hughes et al. (2021), ``An Ancestral Mycobacterial Effector Promotes Dissemination of Infection'' by Saelens and Sweeney et al. (2022) and ``Macrophage NFATC2 Mediates Angiogenic Signaling During Mycobacterial Infection'' (2022), his primary thesis publication. He was awarded a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award F31 fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to assist in the completion of his thesis work.
