\abstract

Pathological angiogenesis is a widespread biological phenomenon that influences the progression of various diseases, including autoimmune conditions, cancers, and microbial infections. One infection in particular, tuberculosis, is associated with the induction of a potent pro-angiogenic signaling cascade that facilitates bacterial growth and accelerates disease progression. A synthesis of early studies on bacterial factors that drive host angiogenesis with modern genetic findings identified the mycobacterial glycolipid trehalose 6-6'-dimycolate (TDM) as a critical factor driving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) production and angiogenesis during mycobacterial infection. Despite these recent findings, many of the underlying host response mechanisms remain unknown. 

The introductory chapter will serve to introduce the reader to the major concepts addressed in this work: \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis} and the disease it causes, the role of macrophages in health and disease, the function of pattern recognition receptors in detecting microbial ligands, the specific downstream intracellular signaling pathway of interest for this work (mediated by the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT), the contributions of angiogenesis to diverse contexts and pathologies, and the promise of host-directed therapies to overcome challenges associated with traditional treatment approaches in infectious disease. 

Chapter 2 describes the new and existing methodological approaches that were required to complete this work. This work utilizes the zebrafish-\textit{Mycobacterium marinum} model of tuberculosis infection to facilitate in depth \textit{in vivo} observation and quantitation of these phenomena. Using this model in tandem with human macrophage cell culture, I was able to model major aspects of the host-pathogen interface, enabling me to identify a critical role for a macrophage-C-type lectin receptor-NFATC2-VEGFA signaling axis required for the angiogenic response to mycobacterial infection and TDM, findings that comprise the core of this work and are detailed at length in Chapter 3. 

The analysis of the large amounts of data generated in this work required creative approaches to data processing and analysis. To this end, I have developed a set of novel processing modalities in Python and R that are capable of the rapid and reproducible processing of images as well as certain aspects of automated data collection therefrom. These macros, many written for the FIJI/ImageJ programming environment, serve as the infrastructure on which the rest of this work has been built. These will be detailed in Chapter 4.

Finally, this body of work leaves many questions as yet unanswered. While it is clear that NFAT signaling is required for VEGFA production, the precise mechanism by which this may work is unclear and could be mediated by either direct DNA binding or indirect activation or cooperative binding with some other transcriptional activator. There also exist a variety of other potential NFAT- and angiogenesis-related phenotypes worthy of exploring using the tools and approaches  I have developed. It is my hope that the findings herein stimulate further study on the contributions of NFAT signaling to the host immune response to mycobacterial infection and evaluation of the potential of NFAT inhibition as host-directed therapy to tuberculosis.

This document is the culmination of my entire twenty-five-year-long academic career to date and would have been impossible without all of the people along the way who have supported, inspired, and taught me all I needed to get here. The number of people who warrant thanks exceeds my capacity to thank them and the space allotted. 

From the time of my birth, I had one member of my family who always knew I could be something amazing and labored to ensure I became all that and more -- my Mamaw Barb. While she was lost to us far too soon, her contributions to my life echo into the present and, were her life's circumstances different, she could have been the one to become the first Brewer with a Ph.D. with her brilliant mind, dedication, and love of knowledge.

My journey into the world of learning would not have been possible without the manifold contributions of those primary and secondary school teachers who saw my potential and worked to help me achieve it. From kindergarten all the way to my senior year of high school I had beacons who guided me to overcome the difficult cultural and familial conditions into which I was born and raised. These contributions are what set me on the path to where I am today and I will forever appreciate those who strove to uplift students from the difficult educational environment of Barbourville.

The inflection point of my life was the four years I spent at Transylvania University. It was truly the place where everything changed. This was where I really found myself and was pushed to my intellectual limits and beyond and I  discovered a true passion for teaching. Paul Duffin introduced me to the wonders of bench science and gave me a platform to learn, discover, and fail that provided me the precise mentality I needed to succeed in graduate school. Scott Whiddon has always been my \#1 cheerleader and has been an invaluable source of support both throughout my time at Transylvania and into the present day. Michael Cairo sparked in me a love for political science and gave me the support, affirmation, and down-to-earth advising I needed to find my own academic identity. Lastly, Jeff Freyman gave me the most rigorous and exhilarating set of academic experiences of my life to date -- the courses I took with him showed me the power to change someone's life in the classroom because his courses, approach to teaching, and pursuit of the Truth changed my entire worldview. More than perhaps anybody else, Jeff showed me how academia can be a path to the \textit{bonum vitae} and set me on this path I am now at yet another crossroads along.

Of course, college is not merely the classes you take and I had the privilege of meeting countless friends who taught me who I was and who I wanted to become, many of whom have been with me continuously for the past decade. Bobby Puckett is the first of my peers I had ever met who filled me with intellectual awe and his mentorship, especially in my first-year of college, set me on a path to further success. He believed in me, encouraged me, humbled me, and supported me all along this path I have taken and fostered my emotional and mental development in untold ways through my entire first-year and continuously into the present. I also had the privilege to surround myself with an amazing set of immediate peers -- Chanslor Gallenstein, Drew Cunningham, Ryan Hanson, Susan Northcutt, and Quentin Becker -- who have been there from the day we moved into Clay Hall until today. And Rachel Johnson kept my ego in check as she outperformed and outclassed me at every turn and taught me so much about humility and grace (and what tuberculosis was). As my college career advanced, I had the opportunity to meet incredible people at every stage who made a difference. Jared Auton is an impeccable soul with a fervor for art who taught me about the beauty of the world around us. Daniel Martell and John Mays gave me invaluable opportunities in mentorship and taught me how \textit{I} could make a real difference in the lives of others. And Daniel Cooper is shining light of positivity and joy who keeps me thinking with an optimistic mindset and with nothing but hope for the future. There are undoubtedly others I have missed, but the sum of those four years and the people who touched my life throughout them have been essential to my personal growth and success.

Graduate school itself, of course, has been a wonderful experience in growth and challenge. From the first days of this experience, there has been one person who I have been able to rely on for support -- Andy Alspaugh. He has always believed in me and my ability to go on and has always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. His kindness is an immeasurable inspiration I can only vainly attempt to replicate for others. Graduate school has given me a body of peers who I have had the joy to meet and learn from at various stages, including Joe Saelens, Eric Walton, Ryan Finethy, Jessie Finethy, Molly Matty, Allison Roder, Shannon Esher, Hannah Brown, Al Harding, Matt Sacco, Stephen Walsh, Dulcemaria Hernandez, and Mollie Sweeney. These people have all impacted my life in critical ways and have helped me grow into the scientist (and adult) I am today. Lastly, I would like to thank Mark Cronan, the devil always on my shoulder encouraging me to try the risky experiment and who kept me in the lab way too late with riveting scientific, political, and personal conversation. He is my model of how to be a great scientist and I am fortunate to have had the pleasure to know him. My time in Durham has also brought a lost connection back -- Austin Farmer -- one of the very few who also left our hometown to experience something different and pursue his dreams and we have picked right back up where we left off ten years ago. 

Of course, my advisor, David Tobin, has been a constant and unconditional source of support and encouragement through the long experimentation that was required for much of the work presented in these coming pages. He provided me the academic and scientific freedom to find my path in science and to fail (repeatedly) with the unwavering faith that I would succeed. His personal kindness has also made the tribulations of these six years possible and he is truly a selfless soul with the unfettered desire to help others succeed. The trials of graduate school would have been impossible to overcome without his constant support. The rest of my thesis committee also warrants acknowledgement for being there for me since the very beginning and supporting, encouraging, and constructively criticizing me along the way -- John Rawls, Chris Kontos, Dennis Ko, and Andy Alspaugh.

Lastly, I want to thank my loving partner in this life, Kristen Stockdale, who has believed in me and supported me throughout the past 4 years. As is often said of the long-suffering partner, she has tolerated the days, nights, and weeks that I was completely absent and, when I finally had a break, welcomed me home with no (visible) resentment and for that I will be forever thankful. She brings balance to my life and reminds me of all the other things that there are to do in the world beyond the lab and her presence reminds me I should probably just go home instead of running that 6 PM gel.

\addentrynote{Gonzalez2017}{\textmd{This study uncovers an interesting role for the phagocytic history of the macrophage in mediating its capacity for future responses. Specifically, this phagocytosis blunted the ability for macrophages to induce future inflammatory responses, rendering them comparatively less able to control pathogens than macrophages that lacked this phagocytic history. This would imply that ``new'' macrophages from the bone marrow are pre-disposed toward inflammatory responses until they have been educated by the tissue environment and phagocytosis to be more anti-inflammatory.}}
\addentrynote{Agarwal2000}{\textmd{This pioneering study identified the cell-type restricted roles for NFATC2 and found that this protein is only able to bind the IL-4 and IFN-$\upgamma$ promoters in T\textsubscript{H}2 and T\textsubscript{H}1 cells, respectively. This was the first major effort at identifying the specific factors that allow NFAT proteins to exert cell-type specific activity beyond simply their expression. This study was very technically advanced for the time and skillfully defined the ways in which a single protein can regulate opposing transcriptional responses based on higher-order chromatin structural mechanisms.}}
\addentrynote{Aramburu1999}{\textmd{Another study from Anjana Rao's lab, this time identifying a peptide, VIVIT, that is able to interfere with the interaction between calcineurin and NFAT. This is a critical tool in the execution of my project and, without these findings, none of the macrophage-specific phenotypes would have been possible to address \textup{in vivo}.}}
\addentrynote{Aronson1926}{This paper was the first description of \textit{Mycobacterium} \textit{marinum} and established the histological findings on the granuloma that have served the field well ever since and defined the etiology of fish tuberculosis.}
\addentrynote{Asagiri2005}{This was the first paper, to my knowledge, to investigate NFAT regulation of NFAT expression and found that NFATC1 acts in a feed-forward loop to drive its own expression to facilitate osteoclast differentiation. This principally opens the possibility that other NFAT isoforms may regulate either their own expression or that of other NFATs; this also begs the question whether other transcription factors can dynamically induct NFAT expression after some stimulus, although this mechanism of NFAT activation is comparatively understudied.}
\addentrynote{Asmar2016}{A very interesting study on the evolutionary rationale behind the divergent ability for mycobacteria to survive in the environment and within hosts. The ability to robustly tolerate salt is inversely correlated with success within hosts, so non-professionally pathogenic mycobacteria face severe fitness costs from host residence.}
\addentrynote{Aurora2010}{The question of how multiple immunologically relevant transcription factors interact with one another in various cell types is an important question in order to understand the actual role of these pathways in native tissues. In this study, the interactions between NF-$\upkappa$B and NFAT were evaluated and it was found that NF-$\upkappa$B induced vascular endothelial cell death via induction of FASL while NFAT promoted cell survival through cFLIP. The relative balance of these effect determined the overall angiogenic effect and evokes a model wherein the balance between these transcription factors can regulate major aspects of diverse responses across many tissues.}
\addentrynote{Barbay2015}{Pro-angiogenic therapy is likely to have many different unintended effects through enhancement of global VEGFA signaling and this study identifies a major effect, which is that the implantation of VEGFA in ischemia results in increased recruitment of M1-like macrophages, arguing for a chemoattractive role for VEGFA toward inflammatory macrophage subsets.}
\addentrynote{Behler2015}{\textmd{This study identified an unequivocal role for MCL in regulating host immunity to mycobacteria, unlike the confused results from \textcite{Behler2012}, \textcite{Lee2012}, and \textcite{Heitmann2013}. This indicates the basal responses through MCL are, potentially, more important for host control of infection than is MINCLE \textup{per se}, which is consistent with an important role for MCL-MINCLE dimers in transducing important signals, which MCL may be able to do alone in the absence of MINCLE and in the presence of high concentrations of ligand.}}
\addentrynote{Behr2018}{Does latency occur in tuberculosis and, if it does, does it matter? In a controversial study, the authors dissect the historical data on this question and conclude that the vast majority of tuberculosis cases are incident to a primary exposure and transition into active disease quickly thereafter. This argues that latency, despite the specter it casts over the field at large, is only a minor contributor to the burden of tuberculosis disease and argues for deprioritizing research on latency to focus on the effects that drive primary infection after exposure. Given that the statistics are often cast that up to one-third of the global population is infected with tuberculosis, the contribution of this pool of potentially latently infected people to the actual disease burden appears to be nominal and could conceivably be ignored in future discussions on how to best manage and eradicate tuberculosis.}
\addentrynote{Bendickova2017}{This is probably the most recent review on the subject of myeloid NFAT signaling, although the thesis of this is that clinical calcineurin inhibitors may impede myeloid responses rather than the opportunities for inhibition of myeloid NFAT signaling in modulating responses for host benefit.}
\addentrynote{Bergeron2017}{This is a really nice study that investigates tri-kingdom interactions between fungi, bacteria, and animals to better understand the role of polymicrobial infections in determining disease outcomes and utilizes the zebrafish model to do so. Taking this as a model, the application of this pairwise strategy to understand how, for instance, airway commensal species interact with \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}, seems like a compelling way to understand the influence of the microbiome on tuberculosis disease outcomes and could likely be modeled in the zebrafish.}
\addentrynote{Bowdish2009}{\textmd{This was the first truly earnest attempt to delineate a signaling pathway responsive to TDM detection and succeeded at identifying TLR2, MARCO, and CD14 as essential factors in the response to TDM. Despite these comprehensive findings, this model has largely been supplanted by the MINCLE/MCL pathway; nonetheless, all studies on TDM-dependent responses should consider the potential involvement of TLR2-MYD88 responses and how those might intersect with MINCLE/MCL-dependent responses.}}
\addentrynote{Britto2018}{\textmd{This captivating study identified a critical role for macrophages in mediating VEGFA-dependent angiogenesis from VEGFA-high tumors, suggesting that these macrophages were involved not in the production of VEGFA, but in providing some other cue for the vessels. Intravital microscopy was able to uncover direct macrophage-endothelial interactions that guided endothelial cells along the VEGFA gradient toward the site of the tumor. Ablation of macrophages, even in the context of VEGFA-high tumors, resulted in impaired angiogenesis. This is an provocative study on how macrophages may, through physical interactions, influence angiogenesis independent of direct production of pro-angiogenic chemokines.}}
\addentrynote{Cambier2014b}{\textmd{This study is a creative look at how a particular cell wall lipid of pathogenic mycobacteria, phthiocerol dimycoceroserate (PDIM) masks immunostimulatory bacterial ligands to prevent host TLR2-dependent responses and avoid a hostile immune environment primed by commensal species within the lung. This role for PDIM is revealing as \citet{Bowdish2009} found that TDM-mediated responses were dependent on TLR2, but if PDIM is masking TLR2 ligands, then that may be a critical component in shifting the reliance toward C-type lectin responses that are less efficiently inhibited by PDIM. This also adds dramatically to the overall understanding of how cell wall lipids influence the immune response.}}
\addentrynote{Cambier2020}{After identifying a critical role for PDIM is moderating TLR2-dependent immune responses, CJ went on to identify entirely novel biochemistry wherein mycobacterial PDIM physically spreads across host lipid membranes to mute the ability of host macrophages to respond and kill the bacteria. This model of lipids being able to directly disrupt immunity through engagement with the membrane itself is a compelling model that may be evocative of mechanisms at play in other diseases, but this will require extensive additional study.}
\addentrynote{CanteBarrett2007}{\textmd{This publication explains the reason why NFATC2 null mice do not have any defect in T cell development and this is due to a specific activity of NFATC3 in regulating the positive selection of CD4/CD8 double positive thymocytes. In the absence of NFATC3, the cells stall in positive selection. This study also sought to explain the role for NFATC1 in these cells and found that NFATC1 and NFATC3 cooperate to allow T cell positive selection and transition to single positive cells. The results also evoke specific and differentiable roles for the NFAT isoforms in inducing these responses as this paper utilized a constitutively active NFATC1 to rescue some, but not all of the effect of NFATC3 knockout.}}
\addentrynote{Chalke1962}{\textmd{This is an interesting look at how tuberculosis has influenced Western cultural development and is worth a read to garner a better understanding of the impact of tuberculosis in the 1800s.}}
\addentrynote{Chang2004}{\textmd{The identification of NFAT binding sites within the \textit{VEGFA} promoter is an important component of understanding how NFAT is regulating this chemokine. This is the first and, to my knowledge, only study that identified a functional role for a particular NFAT binding motif in the \textit{VEGFA} promoter. The particular motif identified was actually inhibitory toward expression, suggesting that NFAT can act to both inhibit and promote transcriptional responses, a hypothesis borne out in diverse other contexts.}}
\addentrynote{Chow1997}{\textmd{While the nuclear import of NFAT was known to be dependent on calcineurin, mechanisms of export remained elusive. This foundational report identified JNK as a critical kinase able to phosphorylate NFAT and induce nuclear export. While other kinases have been identified since, this added needed regulatory nuance to the NFAT pathway as such a sensitive pathway should be able to be dynamically activated and deactivated posttranscriptionally and leave the cell primed to respond again if necessary. It also explained the cycles of import and export observable by live cell microscopy, providing a mechanism to a previously observed phenomenon.}}
\addentrynote{Chung2013}{\textmd{CLARITY has revolutionized our ability to understand a vast range of biological processes and was absolutely essential to our studies on the adult granuloma as it is all but impossible to quantitate vascular association in thin tissue sections, but being able to capture these interactions in their native context allowed us to deeply understand our phenotype in the most complete way.}}
\addentrynote{Clay2007}{\textmd{This study affirmed that macrophages are important protective cells against mycobacterial infection, which had become a bit of a debate in the literature. After depletion of macrophages, mycobacteria grew unrestricted but were limited in their growth by phagocytosis within macrophages. This gave impetus to the discovery of macrophage factors responsible for both bacterial restriction and factors that bacteria subvert to block these protective responses.}}
\addentrynote{Colombo2022}{\textmd{Consistent with the growing interest in NFAT over the past two years, this offers a method and a rationale for myeloid-targeted NFAT inhibition through use of nanodrugs. This should serve as a model going forward for how to target this pathway in a restricted subset of cells.}}
\addentrynote{Conboy1999}{\textmd{This publication outlined an antagonistic relationship between NFAT and NF-$\upkappa$B signaling within macrophages in response to LPS, a phenomenon that urgently needs to be integrated into existing models for the activity of both pathways. This is the first publication to investigate the intersection between these pathway and this negative feedback phenomenon is an interesting mechanism to limit inflammation after LPS detection.}}
\addentrynote{Cosma2004}{\textmd{Is the granuloma a host-protective or a host-maladaptive response? Given the findings presented in this paper on mycobacteria homing to existing granulomas and entering the necrotic core unscathed, it was an early suggestion that the granuloma was the basic site of mycobacterial subversion of host immune responses and set off a series of studies on this phenomenon, including a contemporary study \citep{Volkman2004} on this precise effect and how mycobacteria actively facilitate granuloma formation for their own benefit.}}
\addentrynote{Crabtree2002}{\textmd{This older review analyzed the diverse roles that had been uncovered for NFAT signaling until 2002, which encompassed a rather wide scope of tissues and functions. This vividly demonstrated the importance of this pathway in nearly every tissue and more and more roles have been uncovered in the two decades since.}}
\addentrynote{Cudkowicz1952}{\textmd{This paper contains a number of radiographs that clearly show the vascular involvement of tuberculosis and was an early description of this phenomenon. While they had no means by which to dissect the cause or contributions of this vasculature to the disease, it is a reminder of the relevance of angiogenesis to human tuberculosis disease and that it is not just an abstract phenomenon observable in the zebrafish.}}
\addentrynote{Das2013}{\textmd{Protective host loci are an interesting and complex question in the field of tuberculosis and this work identified MIF as a critical host protective locus with variants in this gene mediating increased DECTIN-1 expression and consequent host protection. This also implies a protective role for DECTIN-1 and DECTIN-1 signaling, although this remains controversial. It seems likely that aspects of DECTIN-1 signaling a beneficial while others are not and MIF may alter the biology of the macrophage sufficiently to preferentially induce these protective responses \textup{in lieu} of the deleterious ones.}}
\addentrynote{Datta2015}{\textmd{Concurrent with the work in \citet{Oehlers2015}, Datta et al. clearly demonstrated the utility of VEGFA inhibition in enhancing drug delivery to the granuloma in a process mirroring that of cancer, where bevacizumab is able to normalize blood vessels in the proximity of the tumor to facilitate drug delivery. This is an excellent companion piece and very nicely investigates the endothelial cell biology in the proximity of both human and rabbit granulomas, giving us perhaps the best ever images of these vessels on histology.}}
\addentrynote{Davis2002}{\textmd{This is the study that founded the zebrafish-\textup{Mycobacterium marinum} model of infection. Little else needs to be said.}}
\addentrynote{Deerhake2021}{\textmd{The first in this recent wave of publications on the role of NFAT signaling in myeloid cells, this study set the groundwork for the next generation of study in this pathway. The authors found that, in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the activation of DECTIN-1 offered protection against disease specifically through the activity of NFAT within myeloid cells while CARD9 activity resulted in enhanced pathology. This revealed not only the Janus faced nature of C-type lectin activation, but ascribed a distinct, protective role to NFAT signaling during this autoimmune context.}}
\addentrynote{Diehl2002}{This nice study delineated a pathway downstream of IL-6R activation that results in the production of IL-4 and differentiation of T cells into T\textsubscript{H}2 cells.}
\addentrynote{Dolmetsch1997}{An early study on the relationship between NF-$\upkappa$B and NFAT, they found that NF-$\upkappa$B was sensitive to transient changes in intracellular calcium while NFAT required longer-lived calcium increases to be induced. Whether this pattern is general to all NF-$\upkappa$B and NFAT family members is unknown, but would be an intriguing study to differentiate the behavior of these different isoforms.}
\addentrynote{Dorhoi2010}{CARD9's essentiality for control of tuberculosis indicates an important role for C-type lectin signaling in host defense, but the precise contributions of discrete C-type lectin receptors in inducing this phenotype remain mysterious. It may be that cutting off the root is needed to fully abrogate C-type lectin signaling responses. Whether NFAT is then hyperactivated in the absence of CARD9 is not known but is a compelling possibility that might explain the exacerbated pathology. Simultaneous limitation of NFAT may have provided some degree of protection, but this is unknown from the results presented.}

Further study is clearly needed to resolve the role of this receptor in the response to mycobacteria.}

Jared was born in the mountains of Appalachia in Barbourville, KY in 1994. After graduating valedictorian (in a class of 57) from Barbourville High School, he enrolled at Transylvania University in Lexington, KY where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and Political Science, \textit{summa cum laude} in May 2016. In the fall of 2016, he began his Ph.D. at Duke University in the Molecular Genetics and Microbiology department, having been awarded a James B. Duke Fellowship. He then joined the lab of David Tobin in the summer of 2017. He attended the Cold Spring Harbor course ``Programming for Biologists'' in the fall of 2017, where he learned Python. In his time at Duke, he has contributed to a number of publications, including ``Cyclopropane Modification of Trehalose Dimycolate Drives Granuloma Angiogenesis and Mycobacterial Growth through Vegf Signaling'' by Walton et al. (2018), ``A Non-Canonical Type 2 Immune Response Coordinates Tuberculous Granuloma Formation and Epithelialization'' by Cronan and Hughes et al. (2021), ``An Ancestral Mycobacterial Effector Promotes Dissemination of Infection'' by Saelens and Sweeney et al. (2022) and ``Macrophage NFATC2 Mediates Angiogenic Signaling During Mycobacterial Infection'' (2022), his primary thesis publication. He was awarded a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award F31 fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to assist in the completion of his thesis work.
